            <h3>Professional Services Engineer</h3>
            <p>I really love to work as PS Engineer since I can interact with the client and give him all the support that he needs. As a PS Engineer, I can be in the middle of the developers, QA, PM, and clients. Having the opportunity of coordinating with all of them at the same time is just fantastic.</p>

            <h3>Project Manager</h3>
            <p>This is one of the skills that I value the most, having the opportunity to be a leader is having the opportunity to serve others instead of being served.</p>

            <h3>QA Engineer - Team Lead</h3>
            <p>As a QA Engineer - Team Lead, I had the opportunity of learning a lot of things about the development world. I had to coordinate with different team, even the final client. Manual testing and Automation have given me the chance of building knowledge in a tech career as a PS Engineer and Project manager.</p>
